Immutable                                                   Mutable:
->Specific value can't be changed                       ->Specific value of data types can be changed
->If Data type values are updated, old variable is      ->If Data type values are updated then there is no change in address. Same
thrown and new variable is allocated to variable              variable will get updated with new values.

MUTABLE DATA TYPES:
1. Lists 
2. Sets
3. Dictionaries

1. Lists: List is an ordered set of elements enclosed within square brackets. The main differences between Lists and Tuples are:
->Lists are enclosed in brackets[] and Tuples are enclosed within paranthesis()
->Lists are Mutable and Tuples are immutable
->Tuples are faster than Lists.

2. Sets: Set is an ordered and sorted set of elements enclosed within curly brackets which holds unique items.
The main differences between Lists and Sets are:
->
->

3. Dictionaries: Dictionaries contain key value pairs. Each key is separated from its value by a colon(:), the items are
separated by comma, and th whole thing is enclosed within curly braces.
