#Immutable Data Types - Strings
'''
In Python there is no data type such as "characters". The only data type to print character and
string is "string" data type.
So when you have a single character, this character is also stored as a string of length 1.
'''

str1='A'
str2="Hello World"
print(str1)
print(str2)

#O/P:
#A
#Hello World
'''
These strings are also immutable in nature.-
