-->Built-in Functions:
-----------------------
Built-in Functions are the functions which are built into(already available) Python and can be
accessed by end-users:

Sorted() -  Returns a new sorted list from the items in iterable.           
any() -     The any() function is the converse of the all() function.              
bool() -    The bool function coverts the value to boolean.           
chr() -     Returns the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer.                   
open() -    Opens file and returns a corresponding file object.                 
abs() -     The abs() function returns the absolute value of an integer,floating point,or complex num.
globals() - Returns a dictionary representing the current global symbol table.
enumerate()-Returns an enumerate object with items and their index values.
int() - Returns an integer object constructed from a number or string x
len() - Returns the length of an object.
all() - The all() function returns true if all the elements of the supplied iterable are True.
bin() - Converts an integer number to a binary string prefixed with "0b"
eval() - The arguments are a string and optional globals and locals. If provided, globals
must be a dictionary. If provided, locals can be any mapping object.
sum() - sum(iterable) sums the numeric values in an iterable such as a list, tuple, or set.
reversed() - reversed(seq) is a reverse iterator on an object of the type that you can loop
through and process. The list and tuple are supported with this function.

-->Important Built-in Functions:
--------------------------------
enumerate():
-Return an enumerate object. The iterable must be a sequence, an iterator, or some other object
which supports iteration.
