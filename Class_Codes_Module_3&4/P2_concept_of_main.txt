Python is said to be very secured language because it is not very easy to hack python websites or
python application because when any python file is created or python object, then various inbuilt 
attributes are created by python for that particular python object and files.
Various inbuilt attributes can be checked with dir().

In that __init__ plays a very important role. whenever function is called, then __init__ block 
will get executed for each and every function. When anything like list is also declared, 
then also, the __init__ function of the list is getting executed.

If any set is also declared, then also, the __init__ function of the set will get executed.

Similarly for any python file, inbuilt attribute __name__ attribute is executed for that particular
file.

Above can be understood with this example:

#File one.py
def fun():
    print("fun() in one.py")

print("top level in one.py")

if __name__=="__main__":
    print("one.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("one.py is being imported in other module")

'''
O/P:
top level in one.py
one.py is being run directly
'''
'''
Explanation: Here fun() is decalred but not called. So, "top level in one.py is printed" and as
nothing is imported, so, __name__ attribute has same name as of __main__which is "P2_one".
So, "one.py is being run directly is printed".
'''

#File two.py

import P2_one

print("top level in two.py")
P2_one.fun()
if __name__=="__main__":
    print("two.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("two.py is being imported in other module")

'''
O/P:
top level in one.py
one.py is being imported in other module
top level in two.py
fun() in one.py
two.py is being run directly
'''
'''
Explanation: Here P2_one file is imported. So, print statement of P2_one is executed which are:
"top level in one.py" and "one.py is being imported in other module" and after that
top level in two.py" is printed. And after that fun() is printed which is declared in P2_one.py
 and "top level in two.py is printed" because, __name__ attribute has same name as of __main__
 which is "P2_two".
